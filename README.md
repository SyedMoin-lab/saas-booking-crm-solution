3. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
   - View upcoming bookings.
   - Track the number of users via the tagged link.
   - Write notes for each session.
   - Access analytical data such as session frequency, monthly turnover, and other insights.
   - Handle payments which are deposited into the client's account.
